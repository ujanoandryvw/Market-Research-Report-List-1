<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Medical Flat Panel X-Ray Detectors Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Indirect Conversion</li><li>Direct Conversion</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Medical Flat Panel X-Ray Detectors market is primarily categorized into two types: indirect conversion and direct conversion detectors. Indirect conversion detectors use a two-step process, where X-rays are first converted into light by a scintillator, and then this light is converted into an electrical signal by a photodetector. In contrast, direct conversion detectors directly convert X-rays into an electrical signal, resulting in improved image quality and faster processing. Both types enhance diagnostic capabilities in medical imaging.</p></p>
