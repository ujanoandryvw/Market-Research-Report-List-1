<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Tunnel Demagnetizers Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Permanent-Magnet Demagnetizer</li><li>Stored-Energy Demagnetizer</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Tunnel demagnetizers consist of two main market types: permanent-magnet demagnetizers and stored-energy demagnetizers. Permanent-magnet demagnetizers utilize a strong, fixed magnetic field to remove unwanted magnetism from ferromagnetic materials, making them suitable for applications requiring compact and energy-efficient solutions. In contrast, stored-energy demagnetizers operate by discharging stored electrical energy through a coil, generating a transient magnetic field to demagnetize larger or more heavily magnetized components. Each type serves specific industrial needs, enhancing precision and safety in manufacturing processes.</p></p>
