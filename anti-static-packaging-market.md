<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Anti-static Packaging Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Electrostatic Shielding Type</li><li>Static Conductive Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The anti-static packaging market comprises mainly two types: electrostatic shielding and static conductive packaging. Electrostatic shielding type packaging prevents electrostatic discharge (ESD) by using materials that create a barrier, protecting sensitive electronic components from external static charges. In contrast, static conductive type packaging dissipates static electricity, providing a pathway for charges to flow safely away from the packaged items, thus minimizing the risk of damage. Both types are essential for ensuring the safe transport and storage of electronic products.</p></p>
