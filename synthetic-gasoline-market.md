<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Synthetic Gasoline Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>"MTG (Methanol to Gasoline)"</li><li>"STG (Syngas to Gasoline)"</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Synthetic Gasoline market is primarily categorized into MTG (Methanol to Gasoline) and STG (Syngas to Gasoline). MTG involves converting methanol, derived from natural gas or biomass, into high-octane gasoline. This process utilizes methanol synthesis and catalytic conversion techniques. On the other hand, STG transforms syngas, a mixture of hydrogen and carbon monoxide produced from gasification of coal, biomass, or natural gas, into gasoline. Both technologies aim to produce cleaner alternatives to conventional fossil fuels, enhancing energy sustainability.</p></p>
