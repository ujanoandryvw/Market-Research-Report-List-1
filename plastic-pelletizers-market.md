<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Plastic Pelletizers Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Wet Cut</li><li>Dry Cut</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The plastic pelletizers market is categorized into two main types: wet cut and dry cut. Wet cut pelletizers utilize water to cool and cut the plastic strands, resulting in a cleaner pellet and minimizing dust. This method is often used for thermoplastics and is beneficial for capturing finer particles. In contrast, dry cut pelletizers operate without water, relying on mechanical cutting, which may produce higher temperatures but allows for faster processing and is ideal for materials that do not require cooling.</p></p>
